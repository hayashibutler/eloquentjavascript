<h2>Functions</h2>
<blockquote>"People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on each other, like a wall of mini stones."

<p>Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming. The concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.</p>
<p>The most obvious application of functions is defining new vocabulary. Creating new words in prose is usually bad style. But in programming, it is indispensable.</p>
<p>Typical adult English speakers have some 20,000 words in their vocabulary. Few programming languages come with 20,000 commands built in. And the vocabulary that is available tends to be more precisely defined, and thus less flexible, than in human language. Therefore, we usually have to introduce new concepts to avoid repeating ourselves too much.</p>
<h3>Defining a function</h3>
<p>A function definition is a regular binding where the value of the binding is a function. For example, this code defines <code>square</code> to refer to a function that produces the square of a given number:</p>
<pre>const square = function(x) {
  return x * x;
};

console.log(square(12));
// → 144</pre>
<p>A function is created with an expression that starts with the keyword <code>function</code>. Functions have a set of <i>parameters</i> (in this case, only <code>x</code>) and a <i>body</i>, which contains the statements that are to be executed when the function is called. The function body of a function created this way must always be wrapped in braces, even when it consists of only a single statement.</p>
<p>A function can have multiple parameters or no parameters at all. In the following example, <code>makeNoise</code> does not list any parameter names, whereas <code>power</code> lists two:</p>
<pre>const makeNoise = function() {
  console.log("Pling!");
};

makeNoise();
// → Pling!

const power = function(base, exponent) {
  let result = 1;
  for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
    result *= base;
  }
  return result;
};

console.log(power(2, 10));
// → 1024</pre>
<p>Some functions produce a value, such as <code>power</code> and <code>square</code>, and some don’t, such as <code>makeNoise</code>, whose only result is a side effect. A <code>return</code> statement determines the value the function returns. When control comes across such a statement, it immediately jumps out of the current function and gives the returned value to the code that called the function. A <code>return</code> keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to return <code>undefined</code>. Functions that don’t have a return statement at all, such as <code>makeNoise</code>, similarly return <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<p>Parameters to a function behave like regular bindings, but their initial values are given by the <code>caller</code> of the function, not the code in the function itself.</p>
<h3>Bindings and scopes</h3>
<p>Each binding has a scope, which is the part of the program in which the binding is visible. For bindings defined outside of any function or block, the scope is the whole program—you can refer to such bindings wherever you want. These are called global.</p>
