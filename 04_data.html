<h2>Data Structures: Objects and Arrays</h2>
<blockquote>"On two occasions I have been asked, ‘Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?’ [...] I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question."</blockquote>

<p>Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the atoms that data structures are built from. Many types of information require more than one atom, though. <i>Objects</i> allow us to group values-including other objectsto build more complex structures.</p>
<p>The programs we have built so far have been limited by the fact that they were operating only on simple data types. This chapter will introduce basic data structures. By the end of it, you'll know enough to start writing useful programs.</p>
<p>The chapter will work through a more or less realistic programming example, introducing concepts as they apply to the problem at hand. The example code will often build on functions and bindings that were introduced earlier in the text.</p>
<h3>The weresquirrel</h3>
<p>Every now and then, usually between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m., Jacques finds himself transforming into a small furry rodent with a bushy tail.</p>
<p>On one hand, Jacques is quite glad that he doesn't have classic lycanthropy. Turning into a squirrel does cause fewer problems than turning into a wolf. Instead of having to worry about accidentally eating the neighbor (<i>that</i> would be awkward), he worries about being eaten by the neighbor's cat. After two occasions where he woke up on a precariously thin branch in the crown of an oak, naked and disoriented, he has taken to locking the doors and windows of his room at night and putting a few walnuts on the floor to keep himself busy.</p>
<p>That takes care of the cat and tree problems. But Jacques would prefer to get rid of his condition entirely. The irregular occurrences of the transformation make him suspect that they might be triggered by something. For a while, he believed that it happened only on days when he had been near oak trees. But avoiding oak trees did not stop the problem.</p>
<p>Switching to a more scientific approach, Jacques has started keeping a daily log of everything he does on a given day and whether he changed form. With this data he hopes to narrow down the conditions that trigger the transformations.</p>
<p>The first thing he needs is a data structure to store this information.</p>
<h3>Data sets</h3>
<p>To work with a chunk of digital data, we'll first have to find a way to represent it in our machine's memory. Say, for example, that we want to represent a collection of the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.</p>
<p>We could get creative with strings-after all, strings can have any length, so we can put a lot of data into them-and use <code>"2 3 5 7 11"</code> as our representation. But this is awkward. You'd have to somehow extract the digits and convert them back to numbers to access them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, JavaScript provides a data type specifically for storing sequences of values. It is called an <i>array</i> and is written as a list of values between square brackets, separated by commas.</p>
<pre>let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
console.log(listOfNumbers[2]);
// -> 5
console.log(listOfNumbers[0]);
// -> 2
console.log(listOfNumbers[2 - 1]);
// -> 3</pre>
<p>The notation for getting at the elements inside an array also uses square brackets. A pair of square brackets immediately after an expression, with another expression inside of them, will look up the element in the left-hand expression that corresponds to the <i>index</i> given by the expression in the brackets.</p>
<p>The first index of an array is zero, not one. So the first element is retrieved with <code>listOfNumbers[0]</code>. Zero-based counting has a long tradition in technology and in certain ways makes a lot of sense, but it takes some getting used to. Think of the index as the amount of items to skip, counting from the start of the array.</p>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<p>We’ve seen a few suspicious-looking expressions like <code>myString.length</code> (to get the length of a string) and <code>Math.max</code> (the maximum function) in past chapters. These are expressions that access a property of some value. In the first case, we access the <code>length</code> property of the value in <code>myString</code>. In the second, we access the property named <code>max</code> in the <code>Math</code> object (which is a collection of mathematics-related constants and functions).</p>
<p>Almost all JavaScript values have properties. The exceptions are null and undefined. If you try to access a property on one of these nonvalues, you get an error.</p>
<pre>null.length;
// → TypeError: null has no properties</pre>
